    "We evaluate the performance of different methods by examining the transcriptional correlation between different regions of a segmentation mask. Specifically, for each nucleus detected using the staining, a target cell $c$ is assigned using our cell segmentation by selecting the cell with the largest overlap with the source nucleus. A similar approach is used to select $c^{\\prime}$ based on the cell segmentation of compared method. Gene expression profiles considering all the genes for three regions are computed: (1) the intersection between $c$ and $c^{\\prime}$, denoted $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text {int }}$, (2) the region covered by $c$ but not $c^{\\prime}$, denoted $\\mathbf{x}_c$, (3) and region covered by $c^{\\prime}$ but not $c$, denoted as $\\mathbf{x}_c^{\\prime}$. Then the Pearson linear correlation is used to measure the similarity of gene expression between $\\mathbf{x}_c$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text {int }}$, as well as $\\mathbf{x}_c^{\\prime}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text {int }}$. The segmentation is said to be better if its difference region has a higher correlation with the intersection region.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating the accuracy of two cell segmentation using the correlation, a low correlation can result from one region having only a few detected RNAs aggregated. For example, one cell mask is almost contained in another cell mask, the difference region for the first cell mask will be very small. To make fair comparisons, we considered only cell mask pairs that all the three regions (the intersection region and two difference regions) have at least 100 RNA molecules aggregated. This cell filtering step can be found in the [supplementary note 3](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41592-023-01939-3/MediaObjects/41592_2023_1939_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) of the SCS paper."
